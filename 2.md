# Abstract

Prove or disprove

$p \lor (q ~ U ~ (p \lor t)) \iff (q ~ U ~ (p \lor t))$ 

These statements are trivially equivalent. 

$M, \pi ~ |= p \rightarrow M, \pi ~ |= \neg{q}$ 

and

$M, \pi ~ |= t \rightarrow M, \pi ~ |= \neg{q}$

For both of formulas

Meanwhile, statements $p$ and $t$ is independent
